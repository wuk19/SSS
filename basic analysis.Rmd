# import the data
```{r}
library(readr)

```

# rename variables
```{r}

###1. Manipulation

```{r}
#participant number in each condition
table(thesis$condition)
#there are 144 people in the high sss condition and the rest of 141 in the low sss condition.
```

```{r}
#manipulation check
table(thesis$condition,thesis$manipulation_check)
"1 = high, 2 = middle, 3 = low"
"in the high sss condition, 9 of them chose 'middle' and one chose 'low'. 
in the low sss condition, 9 of them people chose 'high' and 10 people chose 'middle'.
Maybe people chose 'middle' because it kind of reflected their current status?"
```
